## Election Audit Overview
I was tasked with completing an election audit for the recent congressional election of the colorado area to determine the winner and gather relative data on how many votes came from each county.
 
## Election-Audit Results:

Based on the election_results.txt file. The outcome of the congressional election was

* 369,711 Total Votes
* 306,055 Votes came from Denver County (82.8% of the total vote)
* 38,855 Votes came from Jefferson County(10.5% of the total vote)
* 24,801 Votes came from Arapahoe County (6.7% of the total vote)
 
 
As you can see from the picture above, Diana Degette was able to secure a victory by gaining a large amount of votes. Since Denver had the largest voter turnout, we can assume that her focus this election was getting voters from denver county which has a large voter population.
 
## Election Audit Summary
After analyzing the election data, I would recommend all future candidates running in this election to focus on Denver county. This script determined where the majority of the votes came from and we can modify it to be used for any other future election as well.
   
This script would be an excellent use for a district election instead of County. Another example would be to use this script to help figure out voting records for the entire state for a future presidential election.
